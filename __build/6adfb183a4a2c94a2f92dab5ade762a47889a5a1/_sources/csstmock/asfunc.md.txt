##### module for weight maps 

on going...

##### module for visualization (old version based on Basemap)

Since the basemap is deprecated, I am trying to update it using cartopy.  

Features: 
1. generate a new class inheriting axes class of matplotlib so that it is easy to fine-tune and add some new patches. (**Requirements!!! Basemap, matplotlib<=3.4**)
2. hpviewer function is written to plot the healpix map. 


In current stage, this module has cylinder projection and mollweide projection. 

``` python 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import asfunc 
fig, axs = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize = (12,4))
m0 = asfunc.plot_block(ax = axs[0]).moll()
m1 = asfunc.plot_block(ax = axs[1]).cyl()
```
